Understanding Session Management or Session Tracking :-
****************************************************

=> Http Protocal is a stateless protocal it does not maintain client data on the server end.

=> Http Protocal treats every request as new request.

=> So that we should maintain user data within the session along with multiple user requests.

=> Session Management is concept of maintaining the user information within a period of time along with the multiple requests .

=> Using Session Management we can make our application as Statefull application.


Session Management can be does in four ways :-


1. Cookies 

2. Hidden Form Fields

3. Url Rewritting

4. HttpSession  object.


Understanding Cookie  :-
*********************
=> javax.servlet.http.Cookie is a name && value pair.

=> The Cookie's will allways be maintained on browser cache.

=> Cookie's can be used to carry the data along with multiple user requests.

=> Allways Cookie's will be appended with the request object.


Constructor :-
**********

public Cookie(String name , String value)

=> There are two types of cookies.

	1. Persistence Cookies

	2. Inmemory Cookies 

Persistence Cookies :-
*******************
Here the Cookies  information can be maintained with in the browser cache till some period of time.
So that ever we close the browser the Cookie data can be available.

Ex :- facebook.com , gmail.com  etc..

The javax.servlet.http.Cookie has given "public void setMaxAge(int sec) " method to set age for the Cookie.


Cookie loginCookie = new Cookie("Np.Srinu@fb.com","SrinuTest123");
loginCookie.setMaxAge(60*60);

Here the loginCookie will be maintained on the browser till one hour.


Inmemory Cookies :-
****************
=> The Inmemory Cookies does not have age.

=> Inmemory cookies will be destroyed once we close the browser.

Cookie loginCookie = new Cookie("Np.Srinu@fb.com","SrinuTest123"); 



How Cookie's Works :-
*******************
refer CookieConcept.


javax.servlet.http.Cookie  methods :-
***********************************

public String getName() :- returns name.
public String getValue() :- returns Value.
public void setName(String name) :- We can update the Cookie name.
public void setValue(String Value) :- We can update the Cookie value.
public void setMaxAge(int sec)

=> javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse  has given "public void addCookie(Cookie)" method to add cookie to the response object.


=> javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest has given "public Cookie[] getCookies()"  method.

	which will return all the appended cookies with the request object.

Drawbacks of Cookies :-
********************
=> It will maintain in browser cache so that can get secuirity issues.
=> If we disable the cookies on the browser it won't work.


2.  HiddenForm Fields :-
    *****************
=> An hidden field can be configured using  input type as 'hidden'.

<input type="hidden" name="username" value="Mahesh" />

=> The Hidden Field con't be visible in UI.

=> All the Hidden Fields will maintain on Server Side.

=> For an Hidden Field Extra Form submition is needed.

refer HiddenFormFieldApp


3. Url Rewritting :-
   **************
In a url Rewriting we will forward the data to the servlet using Query String's.


Ex :- http://localhost:9080/UrlRewritingApp/show?username=Ganesh

=> It does not need extra form submition.
=> We can not send huge amount of data through URL Rewriting
