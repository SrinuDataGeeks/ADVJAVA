Servlet's are very good in request processing and very poor in Presentation.
JSP's are very good in Presentation and very poor in request processing.

	
For implementing Enterprice Application we will follow MVC Architecture :-


		refer  MODEL-VIEW-CONTROLLER (MVC Diagram)


MVC rules :-
*********

	=> Within an enterprice application we may have any number of view pages or any number of model classes but we should have a single controller and that must be the servlet program.

	=> The complete request processing should be initiated from the controller itself.
	
	=> The response also should be forwarded to the user from the  controller itself.

	=> One JSP programe should not communicate with another jsp programe directly. The communication should happens 
	   through controller.
